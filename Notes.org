* Deliver Audacious Web Apps with Ember 2.0

  So, the title sucks…

** Starting the App

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     ember new ember-note
   #+END_SRC

   This usually fails with a File-not-found error.  Do this to
   continue:

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     cd ember-note
     ember init
   #+END_SRC

   It picks up from where `new` left off.  Takes forever.

   Then the init call will fail due to unresolved bower dependencies.

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     bower install
   #+END_SRC

** Installing Bootstrap

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     bower install bootstrap --save
   #+END_SRC

   Why yes, the package manager _does_ have a package manager.  It
   also has an unstated dependency on git.

** Update the "Brocfile"

   #+BEGIN_SRC js :tangle ember-note/Brocfile.js
     app.import( "bower_components/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css" );
     app.import( "bower_components/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css.map" );
   #+END_SRC

** Other packages

   The book sets up http mocks using these packages:

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   npm install nedb --save-dev
   npm install body-parser --save-dev
   #+END_SRC

   Which allow the use of this generator:

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     ember generate http-mock users
   #+END_SRC

*** Mirage

    An alternative to =ember serve= that doesn't require a running
    Node server.

    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
      ember install ember-cli-mirage
    #+END_SRC

** Markdown Support
