* Deliver Audacious Web Apps with Ember 2.0

  So, the title sucksâ€¦

** Starting the App

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   ember new ember-note
   #+END_SRC

   This usually fails with a File-not-found error.  Do this to
   continue:

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   cd ember-note
   ember init
   #+END_SRC

   It picks up from where `new` left off.  Takes forever.

   Then the init call will fail due to unresolved bower dependencies.

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   bower install
   #+END_SRC

** Installing Bootstrap

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   bower install bootstrap --save
   #+END_SRC

   Why yes, the package manager _does_ have a package manager.  ðŸ˜’ It
   also has an unstated dependency on git.

** Update the "Brocfile"

   #+BEGIN_SRC js :tangle ember-note/Brocfile.js
     app.import( "bower_components/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css");
     app.import( "bower_components/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css.map" );
   #+END_SRC
